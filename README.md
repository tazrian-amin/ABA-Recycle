### `Details`

This is a Single Page Application (SPA) developed using latest technologies. Especially, we followed MERN stack to develop the fundamentals of this SPA. We used MongoDB database for storing our data. Basic CRUD operation was integrated which gave this website life. Moreover, JSON Web Token (JWT) was also used for user authorization. 

The website is a platform for buying and selling used phones. One can add a selling post if he/she holds a seller account. One can buy a phone if he/she has an buyer account, see details about the phone, add, update or delete his/her order/wishlist.
